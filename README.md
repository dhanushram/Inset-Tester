Inset Tester iOS
===============

This project was developed as part of the iOS App: [My Things - Where Are They?] [link]

When your iOS apps use custom buttons with button images, you need Button Insets in order to make the button appear without any distortion. 
This simple app allows you to test various inset values so that you can arrive at the right inset values for intended button appearance.

##Instructions

1) Open the iPhone or iPad Storyboard and resize the button to your intended button size.  
2) Replace "TestButtonImage.png" with your own button image.  
3) Run the app and press top/bottom/left/right stepper buttons to vary insets. Accordingly the button image would change.  
4) Once the intended button image appears, note down the inset values and use that in your App
